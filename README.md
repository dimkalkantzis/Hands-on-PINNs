# Hands-on-PINNs

## 📌 Summary
This repository explores **numerical** and **physics-informed neural approaches** to solving **partial differential equations (PDEs)**.  
We compare classical solvers with deep learning–based PINNs and their improved variants (IPINNs).  

- **1D Burgers’ equation** solved with:
  - Finite Difference Method (**FDM**)  
  - Physics-Informed Neural Networks (**PINNs**)  
  - Improved PINNs (**IPINNs**)  

- **Navier–Stokes equations** solved with:
  - Improved PINNs (**IPINNs**)  

The project provides both implementations and benchmarks to help researchers and students understand the strengths and limitations of each method.
